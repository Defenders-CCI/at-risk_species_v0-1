### This data offers some measures of outputs, not outcomes

While there is a lot to learn about the Working Lands for Wildlife (WLFW) program using this app and the data is displays, remember that the data here cannot tell us whether the conservation status of the species is improving. The laws that enable WLFW prohibit the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) from disclosing the actual location of properties receiving funds through WLFW; and the biological outcomes of work performed under WLFW are not required to be measured. We assume that more acres treated, and more dollars spent doing so, are improving some aspect of the conservation status of covered species.
