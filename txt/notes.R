# Base file for note text for Shiny apps.
#
# Similar or identical notes are often used in several places within an app,
# and may be appropriate between apps. Collecting all notes in one place should
# facilitate reuse, consistency, and maintenance of apps. In addition, because
# all notes are set as far left on the page as possible, most of the standard
# 80-character width is available for composition (which rarely happens down
# in a nested set of functions in the server/ui code) and thereby improve
# readability.
