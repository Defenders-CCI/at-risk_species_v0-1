### _About_

This is a very incomplete web app using data compiled and made available by Roy Hewitt of the US Fish and Wildlife Service's Southeast Region (Region 4). Please visit [their web page](http://www.fws.gov/southeast/candidateconservation/finder.html) for more information.

### _Quick Start_

A random species is provided at app initiation, but you can then select a species from the database using the drop-down in the upper-right. If no data points show up in the map or no watersheds are highlighted (depending on the checkbox selections below the map), then no specimen records are available from GBIF. Links to other websites are available in the boxes below, but this small app has more potential!

### _Get Involved_

Would you like to work on this app, really flesh out the possibilities? You can [contact us](mailto:esa@defenders.org) or you can clone the [app repo](https://github.com/Defenders-ESC/at-risk_species_v0-1), make changes, and then submit a pull request.

### _Find a bug?_

If you believe you have found a bug, please submit an Issue at the [project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Defenders-ESC/at-risk_species). Thank you for your input and patience!
