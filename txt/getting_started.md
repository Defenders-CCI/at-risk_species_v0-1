### _Quick Start_ 

1. Select the "Interactive map" or "Data" tab.
2. Select filter criteria from drop-downs. 
3. Explore results on the map, in the annotated graphs, or in the data table.

_Only counties covered by Working Lands for Wildlife are shown on the map._ If a county is gray-colored then no money was spent there, and no work has yet been undertaken there. The fill color of the other counties represents the number of dollars spent, the number of acres treated, or number of contracts

_Click on counties_ to get the estimated expenditures, treated area, dollars per acre, and number of contracts per county. Hover the mouse cursor over the bars, lines, and circles in the graphs to see the values plotted.
